    Apply probability smoothing

    This is a way to smooth probabilities between different items to help
    the actual password cracker making use of them.

    For example, if 'chair' was seen 100000 times, and 'table' was seen 100001
    times, it would be nice to treat them as the same probability to reduce
    the amount of work the pcfg cracker needs to perform

    Currently this is a no-op / placeholder and does not actually do anything
