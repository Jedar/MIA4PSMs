Name: PCFG_Guesser Priority Queue Handling Function

Description: Section of the code that is responsible of outputting all of the
pre-terminal values of a PCFG in probability order. Because of that, this
section also handles all of the memory management of a running password
generation session

    Wrapper for a parse tree item

    This is so the Priority Queue can determine where to place a parse tree item
    Aka it holds all the "less than", "greater than", "equal to", logic for abs
    parse tree

    Need to have a custom compare functions for use in the priority queue

    I have to do this the reverse of what I'd normally expect
    since the priority queue will output stuff of lower values first.
    Aka if there are two items with probabilities of 0.7 and 0.4, the PQueue
    will by default output 0.4
