-  Python3 is the only hard requirement for these tools
-  It is **highly recommended** that you install the chardet python3
   library for training. While not required, it performs character
   encoding autodetection of the training passwords. While this is often installed with pip3
   this is not a core part of Python3. To install it:
-  Download the source from
   `https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet <http://https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet>`__
-  Or install it using ``pip3 install chardet``
